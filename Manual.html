            <p>The course registration system allows students to enroll in courses, view schedules, and manage registrations.
                The home page is the base of operations for the site, each page has a link back to the home page so that you can
                do each step of the process as needed. There are six tabs, enroll student, add instructor, register course, add course, drop course, and the manuals.
            </p>

            <h4>Course Registration System Pages</h4>
            <p>The registration system contains the six pages listed above. Each page has a ton of different fields, but each one is labeled with what is the intended input.
                The home page is the home base, its where the navigation bar is and the introduction to the site. The next page is the enroll student page, here we have fields
                for first/last name, major, grade level, and email address. The next page is where an instructor is added, so this page has first/last name, professor rank, department, and email.
                The third page is for adding a course, and this page has alot of fields for the user, such as the class semester, course number, course name, what time its offered, what days of the week its offered.
                This page contains alot of information, but its all labeled with what the intended input is. The register course page is similar, but its just the student first/last name, the semester and year of the course,
                and the course id number. The fifth page is for dropping a course, so fields are course number, semester and time taken, and the students first/last name.

            <p>The system is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend, and PHP/MySQL for backend. The current system is only a series of HTML
                pages
            </p>

            <h3 id="functions">Page Functions</h3>
                <p>In this section of the manual, we are going to dive into detail on how the site functions. The pages all follow a similar format, they have input boxes
                    for individual user information. Page by page they are structured the same, the enrollment and instructor page contains fields for first and last names, 
                    which are just input boxes. Since theres no backend (for now), some of the inputs will be invalid in the future. For example, the register page and enrollment
                    page need a list of majors and there respective acronyms that are acceptable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Generally, there are quite a view drop down forms for the user, so the classes are at specific times and taught on specific days. Some of the fields that are provided
                    are left to be unique for the user, with names, email, and major being a few. The forms are all set up the same, with a label for the box and a tag for whats supposed to go there.
                    The drop down menus are also within that form, so its setup in a way that is consistent across the pages.
